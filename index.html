                Excellency, the then Military Governor of Kwara State, Col.
                David Bamigboye. The decision to establish the Polytechnic was
                announced during the launching of the four Year Development plan
                in 1971. The College eventually came into existence following
                the promulgation of Kwara State Edict no. 4 of 1972 (now
                overtaken by the edict no. 21 of 1984 edict No. 13 of 1987 and
                edict no. 7 of 1994) as a body empowered by statute "to provide
                for studies, training, research and development of techniques in
                arts and language, applied sciences, engineering, management and
                commerce, education and well as in other spheres of learning".

                  polytechnic has as its motto: TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION AND
                  SERVICE. At its inception in 1973, the Polytechnic had 110

            System through which Students can submit their Research Reports [Final Year Project Reports and Students' Industrial
             Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) Technical Reports] electronically for onward Assessment by Lecturers. The system is 
             called a Centralized Online Research Assessment and Submission System (CORASS). Students now login into the CORASS 
             Platform through their Portal. Upon login into the CORASS Platform, students are able to upload Projects or SIWES 
             Report. Students can re-access their submitted reports anytime, monitor the progress of their Project and also check
              their grades prior to the final result Approval electronically. With CORASS, Lecturers are able to electronically 
              assess and grade Project reports submitted by Students. The system is a robust system that is enbedded with
